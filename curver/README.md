# curver!
It's a tone curve editor!

Controls!  
**`**: deselect control point  
**1**: select first control point  
**2**: select second control point  
**s**: open save dialog  
**arrow keys**: move selected control point  

Create tone curves with this graphical tool! Finally, yay! It's a cubic bezier and lets you move it around with the two control points. Later maybe we'll implement splitting the bezier so you can have weirder shapes, but that's it for now. It saves the files as line separated values (lsv) for use with gaze.
