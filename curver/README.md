# curver!
It's a tone curve editor!

<p align="center" style="width: 100%">

![screenshot of curver. there's a bezier curve streaking from the left bottom corner to the top right. two control points, represented as lilac squares, hang in the window area. there is a gentle grey grid in the background dividing the window at quarters of the width and height](screenshot.png)

Controls!  
**`**: deselect control point  
**1**: select first control point  
**2**: select second control point  
**s**: open save dialog  
**arrow keys**: move selected control point  

Create tone curves with this graphical tool! Finally, yay! It's a cubic bezier and lets you move it around with the two control points. Later maybe we'll implement splitting the bezier so you can have weirder shapes, but that's it for now. It saves the files as line separated values (lsv) for use with gaze.
